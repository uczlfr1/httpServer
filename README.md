# server

# server: establish a connection between server and database 
# create a basic httpServer to ensure it can open simple html files
# add more functions to it
# app.get is applied to obtain data from database
# app.post is used to upload data to database
# everytime using the server.js, it is necessary to ensure only one serve works


# Thanks for Clarie and anyone else provide code for us to practice.
